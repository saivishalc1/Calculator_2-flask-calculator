        <h1>Docker</h1>

        <p>

            So, what is Docker might be your first question when learning about it. Docker is a platform used for making containers. Of course you can make containers without Docker, but with Docker it is much easier, safer, and simpler than other containers.
        </p>

        <h3>Containers:</h3>
        <p>
            Containers are “runnable instances of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.”
        </p>

            Docker allows you to manage your applications just like the way you are able to manage your infrastructure.
